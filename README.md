# School_District_Analysis
## Purpose:
Evidence has been found that the grades for reading and math for the 9th grades in Thomas High School have been altered, thus the data analysis of all the schools in the district must be re-assessed to exclude these values. Once the values have been excluded the school district analysis will be re-examined into several sections to examine how test scores fare across **(1) grades, (2) school spending, (3) school size, and (4) school type.** Overall we will take a glance at how the test scores affected the first analysis. 

## Results:

There is a bulleted list that addresses how each of the seven school district metrics was affected by the changes in the data (10 pt).
Summary:

There is a statement summarizing four changes to the school district analysis after reading and math scores have been replaced (5 pt).
